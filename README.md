# Koa React Universal ( 👷 work-in-progress 👷 )

> koa2、react、react-universal-component、react-router、redux-thunk、webpack、koa-webpack-server、async/await

This project is dedicated to build simple yet powerful Koa-React-Universal application boilerplate.

<b>Universal:</b> We are using [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component)、[webpack-flush-chunks](https://github.com/faceyspacey/webpack-flush-chunks). It simplifies <b>universal</b> development with <b>code-splitting</b> and is also compatible with react-router-v4.

<b>Production:</b> We are using webpack to build client(target: web) and server(target: node).

<b>Development:</b> We are using [koa-webpack-server](https://github.com/kimjuny/koa-webpack-server), it also webpacks client and server(with client & server hot-load), so we can stay as much as the same with production.

> Noted: This project is still on early stage.
