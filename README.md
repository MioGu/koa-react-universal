# Koa React Universal ( üë∑ work-in-progress üë∑ )

This project is dedicated to build <b>simple yet powerful</b> Koa-React-Universal application boilerplate.

<b>Less is More:</b> All key ingredients are in `src/development`„ÄÅ`src/production` and webpack configurations, easy to setup and extend. We promise to use official stuffs(as much as we can), no weird or tricky stuffs, keeping this project <b>clean and customizable</b>.

<b>Universal:</b> We are using [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component)„ÄÅ[webpack-flush-chunks](https://github.com/faceyspacey/webpack-flush-chunks). It simplifies <b>universal</b> development with <b>code-splitting</b>(js„ÄÅcss) and is also compatible with the latest react-router-v4.

<b>Production:</b> We are using webpack to build client(target: web) and server(target: node).

<b>Development:</b> We are using [koa-webpack-server](https://github.com/kimjuny/koa-webpack-server), it also webpacks client and server(with client & server hot-load), so we can stay as much as the same with production.

> Noted: This project is still on early stage.
